```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
 
## Loading the data

```{R}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

### First look at the data

```{R}
head(data)
summary(data)
```

# What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Total number of steps taken per day
```{R}
steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum)
```

Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{R}
hist(steps_per_day$steps, main = "Number of steps per day", xlab = "Number of steps", col = "gray")
```

Mean and median of the total number of steps
```{R}
mean <- mean(steps_per_day$steps)
median <- median(steps_per_day$steps)
```

The mean is `r mean` and the median is `r median`.

# What is the average daily activity pattern?

Time series plot of the 5-minute interval and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{R}
steps_by_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = data, FUN = "mean")

plot(steps_by_interval$interval,steps_by_interval$steps, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of Steps",main="Average Number of Steps per Day by Interval")
```

Maximum number of steps  
```{R}
max <- steps_by_interval[which.max(steps_by_interval$steps),1]
```
The maxium number of steps in the dataset is `r max`.

# Imputing missing values

Total number of missing values in the dataset
```{R}
nas <- sum(!complete.cases(data))
```
The total number of missing values is: `r nas`.

Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

To filled the missing data I used the mean number of steps of the interval
```{R}
mean_int <- mean(steps_by_interval$steps)
data1 <- data
nas_index <- is.na(data[,1])
data1[nas_index,1] <- mean_int
head(data1)
```


Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{R}
steps_by_day1 <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data1, sum)
hist(steps_by_day1$steps, xlab = "Total number of steps by day", main = "Number of steps by day with imputed missing values")
```

Mean and median total number of steps per day

```{R}
mean1 <- mean(steps_by_day1$steps)
median1 <- median(steps_by_day1$steps)
```

The mean is `r mean1` and the median `r median1` after imputing the missing values.

There is almost no impact in the mean and median due to the missing values imputation, probably because I use the mean of the inverval.


# Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{R}
data1$date <- as.Date(data1$date)

weekday <- function(d) {
  weekdays <- weekdays(d)
  ifelse (weekdays == "Saturday" | weekdays == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday")
}

week <- sapply(data1$date, weekday)
data1$week <- as.factor(week)
head(data1)
```

Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.


```{R}
data3 <- aggregate(steps ~ week+interval, data = data1, FUN = "mean")
library(lattice)
xyplot(steps ~ interval | factor(week),
       layout = c(1,2),
       xlab = "Interval",
       ylab = "Number of steps",
       type = "l",
       lty = 1,
       data = data3)
```
